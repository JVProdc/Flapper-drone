 <h3>Components & Accessories</h3>
  
  <div class="box">
    <p>1. If your Flapper was shipped to you, it arrived with foam inserts. These inserts are not needed for regular transport but it is a good idea to keep them should you ever need to ship the Flapper.</p>
    <img src="contents_1_anot.jpg" alt="Contents 1">
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <p>2. The content of the flight case is described below, the exact components might vary depending on the model year. Please note that some of the accessories are optional and thus may have not been included with your Flapper.</p>

<h2> Pre-flight setup </h2>

  <h3>Landing Gear Installation (Optional)</h3>

  <div class="info">
    <p>The installation of the landing gear is optional, and is only required if you want to perform take-offs and landings from the ground.</p>
    <p><strong>We always recommend it for novice users.</strong></p>
    <p>Experienced operators can also launch the Flapper from hand, and catch it by hand at the end of the flight. Flying without the landing gear slightly reduces aerodynamic drag, and makes the Flapper a bit more agile in flight due to lower mass and inertia of this configuration.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <p>1. Install the landing gear by pressing it onto the fuselage as indicated:</p>
    <img src="landing_gear_2_anot.jpg" alt="Landing gear installation">
    <div class="important">
      <p>This step might require quite some force, especially when the Flapper is brand new. If pressing it on with only your hands is too hard, you can place the Flapper upside down and use a desk or another hard surface as a support for the top of the fuselage (indicated with the right arrow on the image above). Perform this carefully such that the Flapper remains vertical and does not slip, otherwise you could damage the Flapper.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <p>2. When storing the Flapper in the flight case, remove the landing gear by holding the Flapper at the top and pulling the landing gear down.</p>
  </div>

  <h3 id = "install-wings">Wing Installation</h3>
  <p>The Flapper is stored in the flight case with the wings detached. To install the wings, follow the steps below:</p>
  
  <div class="box">
    <p>1. Insert the leading edge rod into the wing arm, pay attention to the orientation.</p>
    <div class="group">
      <div class="column"><img src="wing_002.png" alt="Insert the leading edge"></div>
      <br>
      <div class="column"><img src="wing_003.png" alt="Incorrect alignment"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="important">
      <p>The carbon rod at the root of the wing should be on the <strong>inside</strong> of the wing fold. If the leading edge has a D profile (model year 2022 and older), then also the round side should be facing up.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <p>2. Repeat step 1. for the other leading edge rod.</p>
    <img src="wing_004.png" alt="">
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <p>3. Insert the wing root rod plug into the indicated cylindrical hole.</p>
    <img src="wing_005.png" alt="">
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <p>4. Connect the wing root rod to the bottom wing arm.</p>
    <img src="wing_006.png" alt="">
    <div class="tip">
      <p>If needed, move the bottom servo assembly up or down to have a good alignment with the opening on the wing.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <p>5. Slide the root rod into the slot.</p>
    <img src="wing_007.png" alt="">
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <p>6. Pull the wing gently outwards such that the root rod locks itself at the end of the slot.</p>
    <img src="wing_008.png" alt="">
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <p>7. Repeat the process for the other wing and you are finished!</p>
    <img src="wing_009.jpg" alt="">
  </div>

  <hr>
  <br>

  <h3>Wing De-installation</h3>
  <p>For storage, or when you need to replace a damaged wing, follow these steps to remove the wings:</p>

  <div class="box">
    <p>1. Slide the root rod out of the slot in the bottom wing arm.</p>
    <img src="wing_010.png" alt="">
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <p>2. Pull the wing root rod plug out of the flapping mechanism.</p>
    <img src="wing_011.png" alt="">
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <div class="info">
      <p>Before you start with this step, make sure the wing is fully folded.</p>
    </div>
    <p>3. Pull <strong>both</strong> of the leading edges <strong>simultaneously</strong> out of the wing arms.</p>
    <p>Should this require too much force (which can be the case when your Flapper is new), remove them one by one, starting with the looser one, while <strong>paying extra care</strong> not to pull too hard, as otherwise you might tear the wing once the leading edge gets released from the wing arm.</p>
    <img src="wing_012.png" alt="">
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <p>4. Repeat steps 1-3 for the second wing and you are finished.</p>
    <img src="wing_001.png" alt="">
  </div>

<br>

<h3>Battery Installation</h3>
  
  <div class="box">
    <p>1. Install the battery by pushing it inside the flexible battery holder as indicated:</p>
    <img src="battery_1.jpg" alt="">
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <p>2. Verify that the battery is properly seated and that the bottom "lip" of the battery holder is providing support instead of being bent. Re-seat the battery if necessary.</p>
    <img src="battery_2.jpg" alt="">
  </div>

  <hr>
  <br>

  <h3>Shell Installation (Optional)</h3>
  
  <div class="info">
    <p>In case you have purchased the Flapper with the optional shells, these are detached from the Flapper when stored in the flight case. The shells are only for aesthetic purposes and the Flapper can be operated without them, e.g. when larger payload capacity is desired or when performing tests which involve higher risk of crashing.</p>
  </div>

  <p>To install the shells, follow the steps below:</p>

  <div class="box">
    <p>1. If you wish to use the landing gear <a href="landing-gear">install it first</a>.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <p>2. Remove the shells from the flight case and get them ready.</p>
    <img src="shells_01.jpg" alt="">
    <div class="important">
      <p>When handling the shells, proceed with caution! They are designed as lightweight as possible such that the flight performance of the Flapper is not negatively affected. This, however, means they are quite delicate. Handle them with care!</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <p>3. Take one of the body shells and orient it correctly.</p>
    <img src="shells_02_anot.jpg" alt="">
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <p>4. The body shells have 4 slots on its side into which the shell holder on the Flapper's body needs to slide in. Start with one of the slots as indicated:</p>
    <img src="shells_03_anot.jpg" alt="">
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <p>5. Then continue with the second slot on the same side:</p>
    <img src="shells_04_anot.jpg" alt="">
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <p>6. To seat the shells properly also on the other side, squeeze the shell gently such that it slightly bends. This will allow you to seat the slot on the shell holder as indicated:</p>
    <img src="shells_05_anot.jpg" alt="">
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <p>7. Release the pressure that was needed to bend the shell; the holder head should slide into the shell slot.</p>
    <img src="shells_06_anot.jpg" alt="">
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <p>8. Repeat the same to seat the remaining slot:</p>
    <img src="shells_07_anot.jpg" alt="">
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <p>9. The first body shell should be properly seated:</p>
    <img src="shells_08.jpg" alt="">
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <p>10. Now repeat the same steps and install the second body shell on the other side of the Flapper:</p>
    <img src="shells_09.jpg" alt="">
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <p>11. Finally, we will install the head shell. It is possible that the top of the fuselage is protected with a cap. In that case, remove this cap first and store it e.g. in the flight case:</p>
    <img src="shells_10_anot.jpg" alt="">
    <br>
    <img src="shells_11_anot.jpg" alt="">
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <p>12. Now you can install the head by pressing it on the top of the fuselage. Pay attention to its correct orientation: the eyes of the head should face the front, the fuselage is at the back, as if it was a spine.</p>
    <img src="shells_12_anot.jpg" alt="">
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <p>13. Pressing the head on the fuselage might require quite some force. To prevent damaging the head, press on the head right above the fuselage (so slightly towards its back) with one hand. When doing so, either place the Flapper on a hard surface and press against it, or use your second hand and hold the flapper by the bottom of the fuselage, where the landing gear is attached.</p>
    <img src="shells_15_anot.jpg" alt="">
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <p>14. The shells are installed! You can go ahead and <a href= #install-wings> install the wings </strong>.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>Body shell removal</h3>

  <div class="info">
    <p>To remove the shells, follow the installation steps in reverse.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <div class="important center">
      <p>To remove the head without any damage, we recommend placing your fingers inside of it as indicated, and then pulling it down while holding the Flappers fuselage next to the battery holder.</p>
    </div>
    <img src="shells_16_anot.jpg" alt="">
  </div>
